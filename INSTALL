Currently installation is tested only for Linux,
but should work for anny platform supported by GNURadio.

Requirements:
 * Gnuradio
 * gr-osmosdr
 * cmake
 * C++ compiler and usual developers stuff ...

Install:
 * Remove __all__ files installed by older versions of RSTT
  (form: ~/.grc_gnuradio /usr/local ... )
  if You does not do so, you will probably fall into strange troubles.

 * First install C++ modules from gr-rstt
  * cd gr-rstt
  * mkdir build
  * cd build
  * cmake ../
  * make -j
  * make install
 * Then install Python stuf (a bit hackyk way) all files are installed
   into ~/.grc_gnuradio directory
  * cd ../..
  * make localinstall
 * Set PYTHONPATH in your ~/.bash_profile:
  * export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/.grc_gnuradio
 * Set GNU Radio local module path in ~/.gnuradio/config.conf
   [grc]
   local_blocks_path=/usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks/
