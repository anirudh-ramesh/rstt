Currently installation is tested only for Linux,
but should work for anny platform supported by GNURadio.

RSTT Consists of 3 parts:
 * gr-rstt: GNU Radio Companion processing blocks
 * rstt_server: Flow graphs for receiving telemetry
 * rstt_cli: Process received telemetry data, vissualisation etc.

== Installing gr-rstt ==

Requirements:
 * Gnuradio
 * gr-osmosdr
 * cmake
 * C++ compiler and usual developers stuff ...

Install:
 * Remove __all__ files installed by older versions of RSTT
  (form: ~/.grc_gnuradio /usr/local ... )
  if You does not do so, you will probably fall into mysterious troubles.

 * cd gr-rstt
 * mkdir build
 * cd build
 * cmake ../
 * make -j
 * sudo make install

I You installed RSTT into /usr/local (default location) there is few
aditional steps You might want to do:

 * Set GNU Radio local module path in ~/.gnuradio/config.conf
   [grc]
   local_blocks_path=/usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks/

 * Set PYTHONPATH in your ~/.bash_profile:
   export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

 * add LD path /usr/local/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local_lib.conf
   /usr/local/lib

 * update LD path configuration
   ldconfig

== Install rstt_server ==
  TODO
  For now no installation is supported, run from local directory.
  Recieved data can be stored in file and postprocessed by rstt_cli
  or can be send trought UDP into running rstt_cli client.

== Install rstt_cli ==
  TODO
  For now no installation is supported, run from local directory.
